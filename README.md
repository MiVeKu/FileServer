## Description

### File server is a basic web application for uploading files to MongoDB database for storage and listing uploaded files in the database. Currently the app can stream back image files for viewing.

Fridge app is built using:
* MonogoDB, a NoSQL database used to store all products
* Express.js, a web application framework that runs on Node.js
* GridFS, a specification for storing and retrieving files that exceed the BSON-document size limit. [GridFS documentation] (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/)
* Pug,  template engine for Node.js. [Pug Github page](https://github.com/pugjs/pug)
* Node.js, an execution environment for event-driven server-side and networking applications.

### List view
Here you can see a simple list of the files currently in the database. The files are ordered by adding date. For every file, file type is listed and links for viewing (if the file is an image) and deleting form the database are provided. The last item in the list is a link to the uploading view. If there are no files in the database an error message is shown.
### Uploading files
In the uploading view files can be uploaded with the provided file manager instance.
